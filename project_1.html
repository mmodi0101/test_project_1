    In this post, I will cover how to do import or export of Collection & Environment in Postman. Importing or Exporting data such as Collection and Environment are a great way to share or request data with others.
<br><br>
Use Case
<br><br>
When you are working with Postman, you typically add bunch of requests related to a project which you can then group them into collections. And, now let‚Äôs imagine, if a new team member joins your project and she needs access to those requests, you will have to give her all these request info one by one which will take a really long time. Instead you can simply export your collection, which she can then import into Postman and will have access to all the requests and the related info.
<br><br>
Now ideally, if you have a teams license with postman you can just add her to the team and call it a day but not all companies have that so this is a good alternative to work with.
<br><br><br>
